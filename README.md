# Just send me random files through Pull Requests or Issues (for a video)
Hello! Here you can just go to the Issues tab or Pull requests tab and attach a file there and I will download it on my Windows 8.1 Virtual Machine! Types of files you can send are GIF, JPEG, JPG, MOV, MP4, PNG, SVG, WEBM, CSV, DMP, DOCX, FODG, FODP, FODS, FODT, GZ, JSON, JSONC, LOG, MD, ODF, ODG, ODP, ODS, ODT, PATCH, PDF, TGZ, TXT, or ZIP files. Credits to Jays Tech Vault on YouTube who did this type of thing. His content is very cool, I suggest you check him out. Username will be credited in the file name. Also don't forget to follow my GitHub account! Make sure to check out the rulebook for rules!
